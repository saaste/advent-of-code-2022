# Challenging days

## Day 11
I had no idea how to optimize the second step. After I learned the prime trick from Reddit, things moved forward quite quickly. I didn't want to copy other people's code so I just learned the principle and then did my own implementation.

## Day 12
I managed to get the answer pretty easily, but I couldn't optimize this to be lightning fast. It takes few seconds to run the second step but that is good enough for me. There is probably a trick to skip most of the checks but I just couldn't figure it out and I didn't want to spend the whole day on this.
